|  A full V-plot has a width of 640 bp genomic region and a height of 640 bp of fragment sizes. An array of 5 x 10 pixels are aggregated together and become a single larger pixel, resulting in a 128 x 64 pixels image. | Figure 1a | |
| SeATAC models the ATAC-seq V-plot using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) framework. | Figure 1b | |
| Four separate tasks for evaluating the performance of detecting chromatin accessibility changes. | Figure 1c | |

|  SeATAC detects differential V-plots. | Figure 2a | |
| Different tools are used to compare dataset #1 vs. dataset #2, and dataset #1 vs. dataset #3 to detect differential V-plots. | Figure 2b | |
| The ROC curves for SeATAC, NucleoATAC and MACS2 for four different shift sizes: 10, 20, 50 and 100 bp are shown | Figure 2c | |
